# Extraction of Emotional Tags from Movie Synopses

## Summary
What makes a movie e.g. suspenseful, dramatic, or sci-fi, and which words hidden in movie plots can predefine this? The answer to that would help extract significant information from narrative texts and build an automatic system that could produce emotional tags.

This project was submitted in partial fulfillment of requirements for the degree of MSc Information Management at Strathclyde University (August 2020).

The aim was to identify, define, and automatically predict a set of emotions in movies based on their movie abstract and various metadata. This was achieved with various data processing, and machine & deep learning tools, with a core element and focus on Natural Language Processing.

The problem was treated as a multi-label classification one, and the result was the prediction of emotions in 55,577 unlabelled movies and the identification of a correlation between the predicted emotions and users' ratings and preferences.

Overall, various correlation tests indicated a strong relationship among users' watchlist and the respective emotional tags. It was concluded that the notion of emotion can constitute an important feature in the movie industry with regard to recommender systems and advertising companies for generating, finding, and placing more personalized content.

The Github link will soon be released.
