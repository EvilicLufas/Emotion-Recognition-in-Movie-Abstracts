# Emotion_recognition_movies
The identification, definition, and automatic prediction of a set of emotions in movies, based on their movie abstract and various metadata.

This project was submitted in fulfillment of requirements for the degree of MSc Information Management at Strathclyde University.

The aim was to identify, define, and automatically predict a set of emotions in movies, based on their movie abstract and various metadata. This was achieved with various data processing, machine & deep learning tools, with a core element and focus on Natural Language Processing.

The problem was treated as a multi-label classification one, and the result was the prediction of emotions in 55,577 unlabelled movies and the identification of a correlation between the predicted emotions and users' ratings and preferences.

Overall, various correlation tests indicated a strong relationship among users' watchlist and the respective emotional tags, and it was concluded that the notion of emotion can constitute an important feature in the movie industry for recommender systems and advertising companies.
